# Games, notes, and tools for the Sanyo PHC-25

I use the emulator found [here](http://www.phc25.com/index.htm) in Linux with
the help of `wine`.

## Games

- basic/blitz.bas : Blitz game in text mode, from the 1984 magazine «MO5 jeux d'action».
- basic/blitz2.bas : same as above but in semi-graphic mode.

## Tools

- k7: ruby script to build a `*.phc` from a `*.bas` and put it in `wine`.
- asm2data: ruby script to «compile» a `*.asm` file into ready to insert basic lines.

## Notes

- notes.md: misc notes in french
